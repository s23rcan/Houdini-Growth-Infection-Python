# Houdini-Growth-Infection-Python

## This setup allows us to create a Infection geometry on the object level (/obj). Inside the geometry you will see some nodes automaticly created by python code. You can replace your geometry with the Grid which name is "Replace_Your_Geo_Here" so just bring your geo there connect the node after Grid node

## There is a Group node which you can set your start point or points from there.
